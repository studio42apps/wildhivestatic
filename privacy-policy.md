# Privacy Policy for Wild Hive

**Effective date: [Current Date]**

Thank you for playing Wild Hive. This privacy policy explains how Studio 42 Apps ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use the Wild Hive mobile game ("the App").

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect Directly

We do not ask you to create an account, enter a username, provide an email address, or share any personal details directly within the App. However, third-party services integrated into Wild Hive may collect certain information as described below.

## 2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services

### AppsFlyer (Mobile Attribution & Analytics)
AppsFlyer collects data to measure advertising effectiveness and app performance:

**Data Collected:**
- Device identifiers (IDFA on iOS when you consent to tracking, Android Advertising ID, other device-level identifiers)
- App usage data (app launches, gameplay events, session duration, level progression, tutorial completion)
- In-app purchase data (product IDs, purchase amounts, currencies, transaction IDs)
- Device information (device model, operating system version, country/region derived from IP address)
- Attribution data linking app installs to advertising campaigns

**Tracking:** When you grant permission through iOS App Tracking Transparency, AppsFlyer may link your activity across other apps and websites for advertising attribution purposes.

### Unity Analytics
Unity collects anonymous gameplay statistics and technical data:

**Data Collected:**
- Gameplay statistics (level progress, session length, game events)
- Device information (model, OS version, country/region)
- Crash logs and performance data
- Anonymized device identifiers

### Apple Services
**Game Center:** If you sign in with your Apple ID, Game Center data is processed by Apple under Apple's privacy policy.

**In-App Purchases:** Purchase receipts are sent to Apple's servers for validation. We do not store or access your payment details directly.

## 3. App Tracking Transparency (iOS)

On iOS 14.5+, we request permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites. This enables:
- Linking your app usage to advertising campaigns you may have seen
- Measuring advertising effectiveness
- Providing attribution data to advertising partners

**Your Choice:** You can grant or deny tracking permission and change your choice anytime in:
iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking > Wild Hive

Denying permission does not affect your ability to play the game.

## 4. How Information Is Used

The collected information is used to:
- Measure advertising campaign performance and user acquisition
- Analyze app performance and fix crashes
- Understand gameplay patterns to improve game features
- Validate in-app purchase receipts
- Provide attribution data to advertising partners (when you consent to tracking)

## 5. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR/UK GDPR)

For users in the UK and European Economic Area:
- **Legitimate Interest:** Analytics, app functionality, security, and non-personalized advertising
- **Consent:** Cross-app tracking and personalized attribution (expressed through iOS App Tracking Transparency permission or Android advertising preferences)

## 6. Data Sharing

We do not sell personal data. Information may be shared with:
- **AppsFlyer:** For attribution and analytics services
- **Unity Technologies:** For analytics and crash reporting
- **Apple:** For in-app purchase validation and Game Center features
- **Advertising Partners:** Attribution data when you consent to tracking

All third-party partners process data under their own privacy policies and applicable data protection agreements.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Wild Hive is rated 4+ and suitable for all ages but is not specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.

## 8. Data Retention

- **AppsFlyer:** Retains attribution data typically for 24 months
- **Unity:** Retains analytics data according to Unity's retention schedule
- **Apple:** Retains purchase and Game Center data under Apple's policies

## 9. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights including:
- Access to your personal data
- Correction of inaccurate data
- Deletion of your data
- Objection to processing
- Data portability

**To Exercise Rights:**
- Contact us at studio42apps@gmail.com

Because we do not store personal data directly, we may redirect requests to the appropriate third-party service.

## 10. International Data Transfers

Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, including the United States where our service providers operate. These transfers are protected by appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

## 11. Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect information transmitted to our partners. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 12. Changes to This Policy
