  <h1>Privacy&nbsp;Policy for WildHIve</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 5&nbsp;May&nbsp;2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for playing <em>WildHIve</em>. This privacy policy explains how <strong>Studio&nbsp;42&nbsp;Apps</strong>
     (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) handles information when you use the WildHIve mobile game
     (“the&nbsp;App”).</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do&nbsp;Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> ask you to create an account, enter a username, provide an email address, or share any
     personal details directly within the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
  <p>While we do not collect personal data ourselves, certain limited information is gathered automatically by
     third-party services integrated into WildHIve:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unity Analytics</strong> – anonymous gameplay statistics (e.g., level progress, session length) and crash logs.<br />
        Data points may include device model, OS version, country/region (derived from IP), and anonymised device identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Unity Ads</strong> – non-personalised advertisements.<br />
        Unity may receive device identifiers (e.g., IDFA), IP address, and ad-related event data to display and measure
        ad performance. We have disabled personalised ad targeting.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple Game Center</strong> – optional leaderboards/achievements if you sign in with your Apple ID.
        All Game Center data is processed by Apple and governed by Apple’s privacy policy.</li>
    <li><strong>In-App Purchases</strong> – when you make a purchase, an encrypted receipt is sent to Apple’s servers for
        validation. We do not store or directly access your payment details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How the Information Is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To understand overall app performance and fix crashes.</li>
    <li>To serve non-personalised (contextual) ads and measure their effectiveness.</li>
    <li>To validate in-app purchase receipts with Apple and unlock purchased content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis (GDPR/UK GDPR)</h2>
  <p>For users in the UK and EEA, processing by our third-party partners relies on <em>legitimate interest</em> (analytics,
     app security, non-personalised advertising) and/or your <em>consent</em> as expressed in your device settings (e.g.,
     “Allow Apps to Request to Track”).</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>WildHIve is rated <strong>4+</strong> and is not directed specifically at children under 13. We do not knowingly
     collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information,
     please email us and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Studio 42 Apps does not store any personal data. Unity retains analytics and ads-related logs according to
     <a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unity’s retention schedule</a>.
     Apple retains purchase receipts under its own policies.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>If you reside in a jurisdiction that grants you rights (e.g., access, correction, deletion, objection),
     you may exercise them by contacting us. Because we do not hold user-identifiable data, we may redirect your
     request to Unity or Apple as appropriate.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We adopt industry-standard measures to safeguard information transmitted to our partners, but no method of
     transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new
     “Effective date.” Continued use of WildHIve after the update constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

  <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy or data privacy in WildHIve, please email us at
     <a href="mailto:studio42apps@gmail.com">studio42apps@gmail.com</a>.</p>
